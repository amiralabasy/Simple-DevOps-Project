# Simple DevOps Project (Applied by Amir Alabasy)

This is a practical implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using popular DevOps tools.  
The original project was created by @yankils, and I (Amir Alabasy) forked it to apply and practice the steps hands-on.

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies Used

- Git & GitHub (Version Control)
- Jenkins (CI)
- Maven (Build Tool)
- Docker (Containerization)
- DockerHub (Image Registry)
- Ansible (Configuration Management)
- Kubernetes (EKS on AWS) (Orchestration)
- AWS CLI & kubectl

---

## 🔧 What I Did (My Hands-on Practice)

- Forked the project and cloned it locally
- Set up Jenkins server and created pipelines
- Built the application using Maven
- Created a Docker image and pushed it to DockerHub
- Wrote an Ansible playbook to provision the environment
- Deployed the app on AWS using Kubernetes (EKS)
- Connected all steps in a complete CI/CD workflow
- Tested everything from source code to live deployment

## 🧠 What I Learned

- End-to-end automation of DevOps pipelines
- How CI/CD tools integrate with each other
- Docker image building & publishing
- Kubernetes basics and deploying microservices
- Writing Jenkinsfile and Ansible playbooks
- Debugging real-world deployment issues

## 👨‍💻 My Contribution (By Amir Alabasy)

Although this project is forked, all the pipeline setup and execution was done by me to improve my DevOps skills.

✔️ I wrote and tested the Jenkins pipeline  
✔️ I created and pushed Docker images  
✔️ I configured Ansible playbooks and roles  
✔️ I deployed on AWS EKS using kubectl  
✔️ I tested the pipeline end-to-end
