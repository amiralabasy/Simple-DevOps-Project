# Simple DevOps CI/CD Project (Applied by Amir Alabasy)

This is a hands-on implementation of a full DevOps pipeline, based on an open-source project.  
I forked and applied the entire process myself step by step to gain real-world experience in CI/CD and DevOps tools.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Git & GitHub
- Jenkins
- Maven
- Docker
- Ansible
- Kubernetes (EKS on AWS)

## 📦 What I Did

- Cloned the project and configured Jenkins pipeline
- Built the application using Maven
- Created a Docker image and pushed it to DockerHub
- Deployed the application on a Kubernetes cluster (EKS)
- Used Ansible for provisioning and configuration
- Monitored and tested the deployment

## 📁 Project Source

This repo is a fork of: https://github.com/yankils/Simple-DevOps-Project  
But all the CI/CD setup and deployment was done by me (Amir Alabasy).

## 🧠 My Learning

This project helped me understand:
- How CI/CD works from code to production
- Integration between Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes
- Writing Jenkinsfiles and automating pipelines
